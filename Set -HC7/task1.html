		<h3>Variables</h3>
		<p>A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.
Correct JavaScript variables
var x = 10;  
var _value="sonoo";  
Incorrect JavaScript variables
var  123=30;  
var *aa=320;  
Example of JavaScript variable
Letâ€™s see a simple example of JavaScript variable.


<script>  
var x = 10;  
var y = 20;  
var z=x+y;  
document.write(z);  
</script>  
Test it Now
Output of the above example
30

 
JavaScript local variable
A JavaScript local variable is declared inside block or function. It is accessible within the function or block only. For example:

<script>  
function abc(){  
var x=10;//local variable  
}  
</script>  
Or,

<script>  
If(10<13){  
var y=20;//JavaScript local variable  
}  
</script>  
JavaScript global variable
A JavaScript global variable is accessible from any function. A variable i.e. declared outside the function or declared with window object is known as global variable. For example:

<script>  
var data=200;//gloabal variable  
function a(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
function b(){  
document.writeln(data);  
}  
a();//calling JavaScript function  
b();  
</script>
