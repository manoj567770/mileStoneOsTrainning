A large, long-lived, and very erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie developed from an extratropical cyclone that was situated over the northern Atlantic on 22 September. It became a Category 1 hurricane early on 3 October before falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. After re-intensifying, Leslie reached hurricane status for the second time on 10 October, reaching peak intensity two days later and passing between the Azores and Madeira. It thereafter weakened, making landfall over central Portugal before dissipating by 16 October over Spain.
